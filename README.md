# mcmc-practice
R code for implementing MCMC and other simulations.

### How to use
It is just script, not R package. You can load script by 'source' function.
But it will mess up your environment. I recommend this way.
```R
BCART <- new.env()
source("./Bayes_CART.R", local=BCART)

model0 <- BCART$lapBCART(Y~., "exposure", example.data, method = "zip")
```
